# 🚀 Flash Cards Sensei - The Force of Learning

> "Do. Or do not. There is no try." - Master Yoda on learning

Welcome to Flash Cards Sensei, a powerful learning tool that harnesses the Force of knowledge! This Next.js application is your personal Jedi training ground for mastering new languages and concepts.

## 🌌 The Force Awakens

In a galaxy not so far away, we've created an interactive flashcard system that makes learning as smooth as a lightsaber through butter. Our mission: to help padawans (learners) master new languages through an engaging, animated experience.

## ⚔️ Core Features

### 1. The Jedi Archives (Flashcard Display)
- A single flashcard appears like a hologram from your datapad
- Each card contains a question in the target language
- Multiple-choice options appear like star systems on a galactic map
- The Force ensures options are randomized for each viewing

### 2. Lightsaber Combat (Interaction)
- Select your answer with the precision of a Jedi
- Immediate visual feedback like a lightsaber clash
- The "Reveal Answer" button acts as your Force vision
- Correct answers glow green like a Jedi's lightsaber
- Incorrect answers flash red like a Sith's blade

### 3. Hyperdrive Navigation
- "Next" and "Previous" buttons guide you through the galaxy of knowledge
- Smooth transitions like a starship entering hyperspace

### 4. Force Powers (Animations)
- Card transitions smoother than a podracer
- Answer reveals with the drama of a lightsaber duel
- Feedback animations worthy of the Jedi Council

## 🛸 Technology Stack

Our starship is built with the finest technology in the galaxy:

- **Framework:** Next.js (The Millennium Falcon of web frameworks)
- **Language:** TypeScript (The protocol droid that keeps everything in order)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (The astromech droid that handles all the styling)
- **Animation:** Framer Motion (The Force that brings everything to life)
- **State Management:** React's built-in hooks (The Jedi mind trick of state management)

## 📜 Jedi Archives (Data Structure)

```typescript
interface Flashcard {
  id: number;          // Your personal holocron identifier
  question: string;    // The knowledge you seek
  options: string[];   // Possible paths to wisdom
  correctAnswer: string; // The way of the Force
  language?: string;   // The dialect of the galaxy
}

// Example from the Jedi Archives
const flashcards: Flashcard[] = [
  { 
    id: 1, 
    question: 'Hola', 
    options: ['Hello', 'Goodbye', 'Thank you', 'Yes'], 
    correctAnswer: 'Hello', 
    language: 'Spanish' 
  },
  // More knowledge awaits...
];
```
